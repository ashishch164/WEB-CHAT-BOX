# WEB-CHAT-BOX
## Description
•	Developed a Web-chat Box using socket.io, in which one person can send message to everyone (who are connected to the server) in one go or individually and also receive messages from them.</br>
•	**Tech stack used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, socket.io, express**</br></br>
->Why i choose socket.io for this ??

Writing a chat application with popular web applications stacks like LAMP (PHP) has normally been very hard. It involves polling the server for changes, keeping track of timestamps, and it’s a lot slower than it should be.

Sockets have traditionally been the solution around which most real-time chat systems are architected, providing a bi-directional communication channel between a client and a server.</br>

## Features
It has a very simple layout. Users can also exchange messages between them.</br>

**Note : This application works only  on my system. I have to write localhost:1234 on browser's URL (where I hosted my server of this webchat application). So to start my server,  I have to execute script.js file, then server becomes active and open this URL in two tabs of browser (just to look like two persons are chatting from two different system).**

## Operations
1. First of all user has to login to the web chat app using username and password.</br>
2. After that chat box will open where user can send message to everyone(who are connected to the server) without specifying name.
3. If user wants to send message to a particular person, then he/she needs to mention his/her name in textbox, then he/she could write message in message box and send message to him/her. They(online users) can also see the messages which they are exchanging between them. </br>
