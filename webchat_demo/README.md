This is how my web chat application looks like: </br>
• First image is the login page of application </br>
• Second image is chat box(after successful loggedin) where users are able to chat.</br>

## Results
• This server.js file contains database of aky1 as username and aky1 as password. So if you want to change this then you can change in the code. </br>
• If you write (in loginbox) username xyz insted of aky1 and password be 123, then new userid is created with username as xyz and password as 123, then that xyz user is also able to chat with other users(who are connected to the server).</br>
